== RulesOfTheRoad == 

As you go down, be on the lookout for lost verses from the Gods.

They'll come in handy once you learn them.

You can keep track of them in your song book.

Stay low. Stay out of sight.

Keep walking, and don't look back.

You'll first have to get through who's guarding the gate...

They'll play dead if you've got the bones and bread.
